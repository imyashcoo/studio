## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) provides a clean and neutral backdrop, allowing the rack listings to stand out.
- Accent color: A muted orange (#D98880) will highlight key actions and interactive elements without overpowering the design. This complements the blue primary.

- Implement a card-based layout similar to OLX/CRED for rack listings, ensuring a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.

- Apply subtle transition animations when navigating between pages or filtering results to enhance user experience.
